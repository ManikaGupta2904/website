I  have used an icon tag to create the website's logo. I have written about myself and other information on the first page. To create various webpages from a website, I used the link taG, which is “a HREF.” When a user clicks on it, they are taken to a different page. I have ALSO used paragraph tags to distinguish between paragraphs and an added “image SC” tag with MY PHOTO that specifies the image's height and weight.-------------------------------------------------------------------------PAGE 2(PERSONAL INFORMATION)<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">        <head>       <!-- <meta charset="utf-8">        <meta name="viewport" content= "width=device-width, initial-scale=1">-->        <title>Personal Information</title>        <link rel="icon" href="manika3.jpeg">            </head>    <nav>        <a href="index.html">HOME|</a>        <a href="personal information.html">PERSONAL INFORMATION|</a>        <a href="Sidelines.html">SIDELINES</a>    </nav>    <body><h1>Career Objectives:-</h1><p>To learn , grow and become a highly skilled professional in the field of Advanced Computer Science  of Artificial Intelligence , Data Science , Robotics etc.  , to be able to handle and occupy the profile of highest ranks in any Organization Structure.  </p><h1>    <i>    Education:-    </i></h1>    <h2>     <u>Undergradate-</u>    </h2><h3><u>Ongoing Courses;</u></h3>   <ol>        <li>Intro to Computer Science</li>        <li>Intro to Web Design & Development </li>        <li>Practical DataScience</li>        <li>Experimental Robotics</li></ol>        <h4> <u>Completed;</u> </h4><ul>        <li>High School March 2022</li>        <li>Stream:Science</li>        <li>Studied: English,Computer Science(Basic Python ,Sql),Maths,Physics,Chemistry</li></ul>        <h1>        <i>Professional:-</i>    </h1>      <br>3 months Diploma in Python &Core Java from DICS, Delhi, India--</br>        <ol>            <ul><h2><u>Python</u></h2>            <li>Introduction to Python</li>            <li>Python Data Types</li>            <li>Program Flow</li>            <li>Functions, Modules and Packages</li>            <li>Python Object Oriented Programming-OOPS Concept</li>            <li>Database Interaction</li>            <li>Networking, Multithreading etc</li>             </ul><h2><u>Core Java</h2></u>              <li>Introduction to Object Oriented Programming through Java</li>              <li>Basics of Java</li>              <li>OOPS Concepts</li>              <li>String Handling</li>              <li>Exception Handling</li>              <li>Nested Classes</li>              <li>Multithreading</li>              <li>Synchronization</li>              <li>Swing</li>              <li>Applet</li>                        </ol>        <br>My cetrifictaes are attached below:</br>        <img src = dics.jpeg alt="Python certificate" width="400" height="300">        <img src = dics2.jpeg alt="Core Java certificate" width="400" height="300">           <h1>Work Experience:-</h1>      Fresher,looking forward to it    </body>     </html>EXPLANATION :The title of the second page, which is about my personal information, uses the ttile tag, and I've also added the fav icon tag.

I've listed all of my extracurricular interests, hobbies, and co-curricular pursuits on the third page. I've added a table, a photo, audio, and links to videos. I have included videos and photographs using the "a href" link tag. When you click on a photo on this page, you are sent to a separate website. Using the "iframe tag," I also inserted a YouTube video link to this page, giving it a certain width and height. To upload my photography video, I utilised the "source SRC" tag. My favourite music is being played thanks to "audio control tag.". I've put my social media handles, such as those for Facebook, LinkedIn, and my email, in the form of a table and written each one in a specific row and column with the corresponding "tr" and "tc" tags.CSS CODE*{    margin: 1.5;    padding:1.5;}body{    background-image: url(15.jpeg);    background-size: cover;}nav {    padding-top: 0.9%;    color: black;    font-size:190%   }h1 {    color: rgb(60, 60, 141);    font-size:200%    padding-top: 1%;    }.pic {    float:right;    border: 1px solid white;    padding: 60px 60px 600px 60px;    margin: 25;    box-shadow: 0 0 5px black;    }h2 {    color: rgb(64, 64, 173);    padding-top: 1%;    padding-bottom: 1%;}h3 {    color: rgb(67, 67, 170);    padding-top: 1%;    padding-bottom: 1%;    }h5 {    color: black;    font-size: 100%;    padding-top: 0.9%;    }p {    padding-left:1%;    color: black;    font-size:120%}ol  > li {        list-style-type: none;        margin: 1;        padding: 1;      }                  li {        padding: 2px;        border: 2px solid #ccc;        margin-bottom: 2px;        background-color: whitesmoke;       border-radius: 10px;      }      table {        border: 2px solid black;    }div ~ img{        border: 2px solid white;        padding: 10px;        margin: 1;        box-shadow: 0 0 5px black;    }#photo {        display: flex;        padding: 10px;        margin: 25;    }h5::after {        color: black;        font-size: 100%;        padding-top: 0.9%;        content: "\a\a";        white-space: pre;         }    a:link {        color: rgb(189, 100, 189);      }    .me{        display: grid;        grid-template-rows: 5%;        grid-template-columns: 70% 30%;      }img[alt = "Tennis Tournamnet Certificate"]{        margin: 1.5em;        padding:1.5em;      }h1 + p{    padding-top: 0.7em;    margin: 0.7em;    }• The padding and margin are both set to 1.5 for all elements on the page by the * selector.• The body selector creates a backdrop image and scales it to fill the entire background of the page by applying the cover value to the background-size property.• The navigation selection determines the padding, colour, and font size for the menu.The colour, font size, and padding for various heading levels are controlled by the h1, h2, h3, and h5 selectors.• An image is styled with a border, padding, and box-shadow effect using the.pic selector.
